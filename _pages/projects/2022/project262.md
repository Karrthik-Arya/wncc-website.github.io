Such a rapid rate of data generation along with issues such as data privacy coming up, often "The project will involve implementing various Economics problems as a Markov Decision Process in a compact way as Gym (https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540). Later we will implement Bandit and Reinforcement Learning algorithms to solve these problems. Some economic problems that we will deal with include Matching Markets, Auctions, and allocation problems. Matching Markets has applications in ridesharing, online dating, job matching, kidney exchange, and university applications. Auctions are everywhere, from IPL team selection to online advertising, spectrum allocation to art auctions, government procurement, and online marketplaces. 
<br>
This project if successful can result in a research paper.

        The scientific world is in shock after the murder of a famous scientist in the streets of Mumbai. Detective Jane has been called to investigate this high profile murder case. Looking at the tampered evidence and remnants of recordings, detective Jane thinks only the students of IIT Bombay can solve this mystery using computer vision techniques. Jane and her team are working hard on collecting evidence which the plan to release every week by collecting surveillance videos or other sources of videos, investigating hotels and nearby shops etc. We, the mentors of the project have been assigned the task to build a team which we‚Äôve decided to call, ‚ÄúThe Watchdogs‚Äù. We need very enthusiastic and passionate mentees to bring the scientific world to justice.
Prereqs: Python, maybe some prev computer vision knowledge and a lot of enthusiasm üí™<br>
