        Ever wish you could polish your writings to better fit the purpose, for example, make them more professional, polite or humorous? Ever wondered if you could paint like Picasso or Van Gogh? In this project, we focus on Style Transfer, which involves the adoption of a different style and change of attributes while preserving the content that you start with. 
        </p>
         <p class="display3" style="font-size:22px;">
        The core idea behind this project is to familiarize with Deep NLP (one of the most sought-after domains of AI) &amp; get hands-on experience with various deep network architectures while trying to accomplish 2 major tasks: Text Style Transfer &amp; Image Style Transfer.
